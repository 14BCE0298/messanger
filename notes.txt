1. REST services borrow the below mentioned mechanisms from HTTP :-
    -   Resource based URL's
    -   HTTP methods are used {GET, PUT, POST, DELETE}
    -   Responce responds back with appropriate HTTP status codes.
    -   Responce should have appropriate headers like content-type.

2. The REST Resource URI's are of 2 types
    -   Instance URI - Get details for single Resource. EX - /messages/{messageId}
    -   Collection URI - Get a collection of details. EX - /messages

3. Query parameters can be used for Pagination and Filtering. EX - /messages/{messageId}?results=10&year=2014.

4. When creating a new resource instance we use the POST method with collections URI. EX - /messages

5.  Idempotent methods - GET, PUT, DELETE {Can be repeated}
    Non-Idempotent methods - POST

6. The different error codes classes are mentioned below :-
    -   1XX - Informational
    -   2XX - Success
    -   3XX - Redirection
    -   4XX - Client error
    -   5XX - Server error

7. HATEOAS is a way to provide client link to various resources as a responce to an api call so that no URL creation has to be done at client side.

8. In SOAP services only one API end point is exposed and the request body contains details for what operation is to be performed.

9. According to Richardson Maturity Model below mentioned are the levels of REST service achived :-

    -   Lvl 0 - Using single API endpoint
    -   Lvl 1 - Using resource based URI'service
    -   Lvl 2 - Using HTTP methods {POST, PUT etc}
    -   Lvl 3 - HATEOAS

10. JAX-RS is a set of interfaces and annotations that has api's for REST services. Library classes like jersey or RESTeasy 
implement these interfaces and make sense of the annotations wherever the JAX-RS api's are used. Every JAX-RS Library comes
with a copy of JAX-RS.
